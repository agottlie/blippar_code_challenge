## Synopsis

This is a my first project made using Blippar's API.  I have created an augmented reality experience with several features.  For the blipp itself, pretty much everything is tappable.  You can tap the cube on the main page to move it around, and all the social icons are live links.  Tapping my name also takes you to my portfolio.  There are a few shapes drawn on this page as well.

On the secondary page, the video plays upon tapping it, and you can click the "tap me" text to see a fireworks particle effect.  Tapping that again will stop the fireworks.  Finally, the back button takes you back to the homepage.


## Requirements

To access the blipp, simply download the Blippar app, open it up and point it at the Marker images in this folder.  You will first need to put it in a test code, as the blipp is not live.  To do that, go to Settings, then tapp Enter a Code, and input 612162.  If you want to fork and update the code, please see [here](https://developer.blippar.com/portal/ar-api/guides/testing-publishing/testing/) about how to side-load the experience.
